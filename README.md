A simple, fast, no dependency, Go powered Vector Database

## Features

- Efficient nearest neighbor search using k-d trees.
- Easy to use
- Platform independent (when using Docker)
- Includes Classifiers (SVM / Neural Nets) - you can use the Database as Classifier (Pictures, Text, Sound etc etc)
- "Distanceaware" Filtering
- Supports multiple collections.

- git clone https://github.com/spookieoli/VreeDB
- docker build -t vreedb .
- docker run -p 8080:8080 vreedb
- docker run -v C:\collections:/collections -p 8080:8080 --name vreedb_test vreedb

Once up - you can access the UI at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
